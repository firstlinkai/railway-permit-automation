# Railway Permit-to-Work Automation
## Digital Transformation for Railway Operations

### Project Overview
A fully-functional digital permit-to-work system for railway operations. Built using n8n, Airtable, and automation tools to reduce permit processing from 3 days to 3 hours.

### Target Audience
- Railway Facilities/Operations Managers
- Maintenance Department Heads
- Safety Officers
- Procurement Managers

### Quick Start
1. **Review the Blueprint** - `Railway_Permit_Automation_Blueprint.md`
2. **Explore the n8n Workflow** - `n8n-workflow.json`
3. **Set up Airtable Base** - `airtable-structure.md`
4. **Walk through the Demo** - `demo-script.md`
