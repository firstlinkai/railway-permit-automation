## Opening (30 seconds)

"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. As someone who understands railway systems, I've seen firsthand how manual permit paperwork slows down maintenance teams and creates compliance risks.

Today I'll show you a digital permit system built specifically for railway operations that cuts processing from 3 days to 3 hours. Let me walk you through how it works."

---

## Step 1: The Problem - Manual Process (1 minute)

**Show:** Side-by-side comparison
- **Left:** Photo of paper permit forms, spreadsheets, filing cabinets
- **Right:** Digital dashboard with real-time tracking

"Currently, your team probably deals with:
1. Paper forms that get lost or delayed
2. Manual routing between supervisor → safety → permit issuer
3. No real-time visibility on permit status
4. Compliance nightmares during audits

This leads to maintenance delays and regulatory risks."

---

## Step 2: Mobile Submission (1 minute)

**Demo:** Worker submits permit via mobile form

"Watch as a maintenance worker submits a permit request from their phone:

1. **Open mobile form** - Simple, mobile-friendly interface
2. **Fill details** - Work type, location, duration, contractor
3. **Upload JSA** - Job Safety Analysis document
4. **Submit** - One tap submission

The worker gets instant confirmation and tracking ID."

**Key Point:** "No more walking back to the office to fill paperwork."

---

## Step 3: Automated Routing (1.5 minutes)

**Demo:** Real-time routing through approval chain

"Now watch the automated routing:

1. **Supervisor notification** - Slack/Email with one-click approval
2. **Safety officer review** - For high-risk work (automatically flagged)
3. **Permit issuer final approval**

Each approver sees:
- Work details
- Hazards identified
- Previous approvals
- Quick approve/reject buttons

**Key Point:** "No more chasing people down for signatures."

---

## Step 4: Digital Permit Issuance (1 minute)

**Demo:** PDF generation with QR code

"Once approved, the system automatically:
1. **Generates PDF permit** with QR code
2. **SMS to worker** with permit link
3. **Updates dashboard** in real-time

The QR code allows site security to verify validity instantly."

**Show:** Sample permit PDF with QR code and all details

---

## Step 5: Real-time Dashboard (1 minute)

**Demo:** Live dashboard showing all permits

"Now let's look at the operations dashboard:

1. **Active permits** - Color-coded by status
2. **Processing times** - Average 3 hours vs 3 days
3. **Compliance tracking** - Every action logged for audits
4. **Analytics** - Bottlenecks, peak times, contractor performance

You can filter by location, department, or contractor."

**Key Point:** "Complete visibility across all operations."

## Step 6: ROI & Impact (1 minute)

**Show:** ROI calculator spreadsheet

"Here's the impact we've seen:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Processing time | 3 days | 3 hours |
| Administrative hours/week | 20 | 4 |
| Lost/misplaced permits | 5% | 0% |
| Audit preparation | 40 hours | 2 hours |

**Annual savings:** $25,000+ per department
**Payback period:** 2-3 months"

---

## Step 7: Your Specific Application (30 seconds)

**Customize based on prospect:**
- **For Facilities Managers:** "This would eliminate your permit backlog"
- **For Safety Officers:** "Automated JSA tracking and hazard flagging"
- **For Procurement:** "Contractor performance tracking and compliance"

---

## Closing & Next Steps (1 minute)

"The system is built using n8n and Airtable - tools you might already use. Implementation takes about 2 weeks, with minimal disruption.

**Next steps:**
1. I can set up a test environment with your data
2. Run a 30-day pilot with one department
3. Measure the actual time savings

Would you like to see how this would work specifically for your [mention their department] team?"
